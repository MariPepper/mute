        <h1>Cookie Policy for Multi-User Timed Encrypted Chat (MUTE)</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 26, 2025</p>
        <p>We value your privacy. This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies in our Multi-User Timed Encrypted Chat (MUTE) application to provide a secure and efficient chat experience.</p>
        
        <h2>What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit. We also use similar technologies, such as local storage and session storage, to enhance your experience and ensure the application functions correctly.</p>
        
        <h2>How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>Our chat application currently uses the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We store a consent flag to record your agreement to use local and session storage, which are essential for chat functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To manage user consent and ensure the application operates correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Persistent until you clear your browser data.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Storage:</strong> We temporarily store encryption keys and related metadata to facilitate secure message encryption and decryption during your session.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Essential for secure chat functionality and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Temporary, cleared when you close your browser tab or session.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chat messages are encrypted and stored on our servers with a 5-minute expiration time. Decrypted messages are displayed in the application and held in memory temporarily but are not stored in local or session storage. Messages are automatically removed from display after 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>We do not currently use traditional cookies. If we introduce them in the future, they may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> To maintain your chat session securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Essential for operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Expires when you close your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> To remember your settings (e.g., chat display options).</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enhance user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Up to 1 year, unless cleared.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use cookies or similar technologies for advertising or third-party tracking.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> You can disable local storage or session storage in your browser settings, but this will prevent the chat application from functioning, as these technologies are essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Data:</strong> Use your browser’s “Clear Data” option to remove stored consent flags or session data at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You must accept the use of local and session storage to use the chat. If you reject consent, you will be redirected away from the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Consent:</strong> If we add non-essential cookies in the future, we will provide a consent popup to allow you to opt in or out.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy as our application evolves. Please check back here for the latest version.</p>
